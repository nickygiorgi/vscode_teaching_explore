# Prerequisites

* Desktop version of VSCode
* Installing pyodbc module (In Thonny: Tools -> Manage Packages -> install pyodbc using PyPi)

# How to use

* Open the script and run as any other python program
* Turn into a module by dropping the python code into a folder with an __init__.py file into it (to tell python it's a package) and then 'from folder_name import AccessInterface'
* Package into an .exe file to double click
** Pupils write SQL code into a script then double click the .exe and that executes commands in the script. However, that would need a wee interface (UI or command line)

# VSCode

* VSCode is an official Microsoft product
* It is used in industry (although not by everyone!)
* It has a large marketplace of extensions which are actively worked on and maintained
** Not all extensions are commercial, many are community oriented
* Accessibility:
** Zoom in / zoom out using Ctrl+= and Ctrl+-
** High contrast themes built in
** VS Code Speech is a Microsoft official extension for text to speech and speech to text and includes integration with copilot - haven't tested yet
** There is also screen reader integration through extensions but I haven't tested these either, yet
